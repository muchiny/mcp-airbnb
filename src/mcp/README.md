# 📡 MCP Protocol Layer

The **MCP layer** exposes domain capabilities as [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) tools over stdio using the `rmcp` 1.4 SDK. It is a thin interface layer — all business logic lives in the adapters and domain.

## 🛠️ Server

### `AirbnbMcpServer`

The main server struct, defined in `server.rs`. It uses rmcp macros:

- **`#[tool_router]`** on the `impl` block — registers all 18 tool methods
- **`#[tool(...)]`** on each method — defines tool name, description, and annotations
- **`#[tool_handler]`** on the `ServerHandler` impl — provides server info and capabilities

The server holds an `Arc<dyn AirbnbClient>`, allowing dependency injection of any `AirbnbClient` implementation.

## 🤖 AI-Facing Documentation

The server sends structured metadata to AI assistants during the MCP handshake. This is what makes AI understand what this server can do:

### 📋 Instructions (sent once per session)

The `instructions` field provides workflow guidance and tool relationships:

```
Airbnb MCP server for searching and analyzing short-term rental listings.

## Data Tools
Start with airbnb_search to find listings by location. Each result includes a listing ID
you can use with other tools:
- airbnb_listing_details: full description, amenities, house rules, photos, capacity

- airbnb_price_calendar: daily prices and availability for 1-12 months
- airbnb_host_profile: host bio, superhost status, response rate, languages
- airbnb_occupancy_estimate: occupancy rate, weekday vs weekend pricing, monthly breakdown
- airbnb_neighborhood_stats: area-level avg/median prices, ratings, property types

## Analytical Tools
- airbnb_compare_listings: compare 2-100+ listings side-by-side with percentile rankings
- airbnb_price_trends: seasonal pricing analysis (peak/off-peak, weekend premium, volatility)
- airbnb_gap_finder: detect orphan nights and booking gaps with lost revenue estimate
- airbnb_revenue_estimate: project ADR, occupancy, monthly/annual revenue
- airbnb_listing_score: quality audit (0-100) with improvement suggestions
- airbnb_amenity_analysis: missing popular amenities vs neighborhood competition
- airbnb_market_comparison: compare 2-5 neighborhoods side-by-side
- airbnb_host_portfolio: analyze a host's full property portfolio
- airbnb_review_sentiment: keyword-based sentiment analysis of guest reviews

## Resources
Data fetched by tools is cached as MCP resources. Use resource URIs to reference previously fetched data without re-scraping.

## Tips
- Use airbnb_compare_listings with a location to analyze an entire market (up to 100 listings).
- Use airbnb_listing_score + airbnb_amenity_analysis for a complete listing audit.
- Use airbnb_revenue_estimate to evaluate investment potential.
- Pagination: pass the cursor from a previous response to get the next page.
